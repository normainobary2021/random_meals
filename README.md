# random_meals
> This Project is a basic front-end Meals App that fetches random means from
> https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
> Everytime a user taps the Get Meal button, a new Recipe shows up with all 
> ingredients and a Youtube video tutorial for making the dish.

> Special Thanks to [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) for allowing to use their code
